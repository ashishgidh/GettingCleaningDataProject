# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==========================================

The repository has the R code and documentation for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" whics is part of the Data Science track.

The dataset which is being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
This could be kept in a folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory of R. 

The code assumes that the data is in a subfolder under the working directory "UCI HAR Dataset".

run_analysis.R file contains the code to perform the required analysis and output the final results in a file which are also uploaded in this repository. 

The `CodeBook.md` file describes the variables, techniques, data, and any cldaning/transformations work.
